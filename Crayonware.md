# What's Crayonware
Hi.  I'm a primary care provider in New Mexico.  Providers are required to comply with the ban on Dangerous Abbreviations in medical charting.  But who can remember them all, and in what detail?  My ACS project was to develop software to auto-replace the dangerous abbreviations with acceptable text.  Does it work?  And how!  If you want to try it in a sandbox, you can lift it off of my GitHub repository.at  SteveofCalley /NCCproject   The operating executable is NCC-MERP 2.1.exe and the list of forbidden abbreviations is on NCC-MERP.pdf  I call it "crayon-ware," it's so darn simple to go from concept to executable, it could be planned in crayon on the back of a lunch bag.  The big bang is in the idea.  I am only allowed to deploy it on my own machine, but it could be slipped into the bootware of EVERY person who uses the medical record for treatment notes - pharmacists and providers.  It could benefit all of these providers nationwide.  All you need is a small beta test.  AND SINCE it was developed as a VA PROJECT ON VA TIME, it belongs to the VA!  It's shared by MIT license, but it costs nothing.  OK, so -- costs nothing - fully operational - to have the potential to be used in all medical records EMR's - and is compatible AS IS with Cerner. Try it out!
